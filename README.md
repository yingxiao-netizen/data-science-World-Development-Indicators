# data-science-World-Development-Indicators

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the comprehension of python coding for data analyzation and visualization and present it in a Jupyter notebook.

Data of World Development Indicators were extracted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/world-development-indicators?select=Indicators.csv.)

1. Load the data into data frames.
2. The data were inspected, to get a feel for it - what the columns are, what ranges of values they contain, how they are related, and so on.
3. Some questions that I found interesting about the data were posed - ones that will require enough manipulation to demonstrate analyzation and visualization skills.
4. Clean the data as required.
5. Manipulate the data as required, to get answers to my own questions.
6. Answers were illustrated using tables and plots if applicable.
